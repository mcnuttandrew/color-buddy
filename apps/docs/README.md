# Color Buddy Docs page

This is a standard [vite-press](https://vitepress.dev/) documentation page covering the color buddy application and associated libraries. To run it locally, navigate to this folder, and then install `yarn`, and then run `yarn docs:dev`.

The docs for the subpackages (e.g. the linter) are generated automatically from their readmes/type definitions. To update them, from the root run `yarn update-docs`.
