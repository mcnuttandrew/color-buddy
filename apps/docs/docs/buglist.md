Bugs and small improvemtns

- In the github, the link to the docs is wrong. It's OK in the app

# Browse/Manage
- After clicking on a palette, the palette updates and the tab switches to samples. Leave the tab on the view of the palettes
- In the manage pane, make the windows tight on the palettes, as in Browse

# Color spaces
- when you change the color space, dismiss the menu once you select one.
- Selecting a new palette changes the color space back to LAB. It shouldn't
- Update the color space descriptions (details TBD from Maureen)
- JZ values are all in the range 0-0.1, think you need to scale by 10. Don't know the colorspace well enough to evaluate JA and JB
- No color space background for JAJBJZ
- I'd remove the SRGB editing space. Even if it's working correctly (which I think it isn't), it's going to be very confusing.
