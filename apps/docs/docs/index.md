# Color Buddy

This is the documentation page for our tool [Color Buddy](https://radiant-speculoos-7f8b2f.netlify.app/). The goal of Color Buddy is to help you make excellent color palettes for data visualization via a direct manipulation environment that evaluates your color palettes as you go. The easiest way to get started with Color Buddy is just to jump right in and start messing around with it!

We check color palettes through a checker called [Palette Lint](http://localhost:5173/palette-lint-api.html). Like other linters, palette lint takes in a collection of checks and palette and evaluate the palette for each of those checks. If this is not familiar, that's okay! Think of it like a spell checker for color.

To learn more about some of the ideas behind this work, see our paper (TBA).
