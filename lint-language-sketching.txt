# Usability Checks
Color Name discriminability: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, NAME(a) != NAME(b)
Thin Discriminability: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, JND(a, b, thin) > threshold
Medium Discriminability: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, JND(a, b, medium) > threshold
Wide Discriminability: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, JND(a, b, wide) > threshold
Sequential: OR (ALL_SEQ colors next current, lab(current, l) > lab(next, l)) (ALL_SEQ colors next current, lab(current, l) < lab(next, l))
Diverging: 

# Aesthetics Checks
Max Colors: count(colors) < threshold
Palette does not have ugly colors: NOT ALL c in colors, ALL u in ugly, c similar to u
Avoid extreme colors: NOT ALL c in colors, ALL e in extreme, c equal to e
Fair: range(colors, lch, c) < threshold_1 AND range(colors, lch, l) < threshold_2

# Accessibility Checks
Colorblind Friendly for deuteranopia: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, NOT (sim(a) similar to sim(b))
Colorblind Friendly for protanopia: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, NOT (sim(a) similar to sim(b))
Colorblind Friendly for tritanopia: ALL colors a, ALL colors b, NOT (sim(a) similar to sim(b))
All colors differentiable from background: ALL colors c, deltaE(c, bg) > threshold
Background Contrast: ALL colors c, contrast(c, bg) > threshold

# Ad Hoc-y ideas: 
All complementary Pairs: ALL colors a, EXIST color b, hue(a) approx hue(b) + PI
Exist complementary pair: EXIST colors a, EXIST color b, hue(a) approx hue(b) + PI
All monochromatic: ALL colors a, EXIST color b, hue(a) approx hue(b)

Gender Colors Not Conformist: NOT ((EXIST color a similar to "LIGHT BLUE") AND (EXIST color b similar to "PINK"))

Specific value included: EXIST color a, value(a) equal to X


# Affective Color Assertions
"Highly saturated light colors will not be appropriate for SERIOUS/TRUST/CALM": ALL (FILTER colors c, lab(c) > threshold) b, NOT hsl(b) > threshold
"light blues, beiges, and grays are appropriate for PLAYFUL"
"dark reds and browns are not POSITIVE": ALL colors c, NOT (c similar to "DARK RED" OR c similar to "BROWN")
"light colors, particularly greens, do not communicate NEGATIVE"
"trustworthy has two themeatic strategies (blue-gray, green-gray) bridge by a common color (yellow)"
