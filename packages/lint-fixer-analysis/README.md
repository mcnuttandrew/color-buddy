# Lint Fixer Analysis

This repo contains an experiment that analyzes the fixers capabilities. It uses the version made at submission time. To recreate the data, ensure that you have a .env file like, it should be a sibling to the prompter.ts file in this directory.

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_TOKEN
ANTHROPIC_KEY=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Install the deps

```sh
yarn
```

Run the analysis

```sh
yarn test
```

The analysis is conducted in a jupyter notebook in the analysis.ipynb file. It uses the data generated by the test command. It uses standard altair/pandas/jupyter for analysis, so you should set up your local python environment with those dependencies in what way is most comfortable.
