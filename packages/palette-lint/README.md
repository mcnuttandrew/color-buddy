# Palette Check

Have you ever looked closely at a color palette and wondered if it was a good palette or just the one you had? Palette Check is a tool that helps you evaluate the quality of a color palette. It operates analogously to a spell checker (or more closely, like a linter), but for color palettes. It will help you identify issues with your palette and suggest improvements.

Palette check's usage is centered around Color library, that, in turn wraps the extremely powerful [colorjs.io](https://colorjs.io/).
