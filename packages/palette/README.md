# @color-buddy/palette

This package is a collection of tools for working with color palettes. It is built on top of the [Color](https://colorjs.io) library. Palette lint's usage is centered around Color library, that, in turn wraps the extremely powerful [colorjs.io](https://colorjs.io/).

```ts
export {
  toPal,
  wrapColor,
  makePalFromString,
  Color,
  ColorSpaceDirectory,
  distributePoints,
  clipToGamut,
};

export type { Palette, StringPalette, ColorWrap, ColorSpace, PalType };
```
